# News-Category-Classifiers-and-Clusterings
A repository for my Project for Data Mining I and Concepts in Artifical Intelligence. My goal is to build a few different news category classifiers and compare them. In addition to this, I want to implement a few clustering algorithms and see how well the different algorithms can cluster the same articles. Both the Classifiers and the Clustering algorithms will be tested on multiple dense word vector representation (Word2Vec, GLoVe, and FastText).

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
- A newer version of Python must be installed. This was made using Python 3.7.9

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/MathewTWilliams/News-Category-Classifiers
```
2. Make a new virtual environment
```sh
python -m venv '/path/to/env'
```
3. Activate Virtual Environment (on Windows)
```sh
./path/to/env/Scripts/activate
```

4. Install requirements
```sh
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```
5. Download the data set: https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-category-dataset

6. Make and folder Named 'Data' that sits in the same location as the Scripts folder from the repository.

7. Move the downloaded dataset (keeping the same name) into the newly made 'Data Folder'
